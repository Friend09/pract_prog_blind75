**Explain this algorithm with a comprehensive step-by-step breakdown:**

**Requirements:**
1. **Use specific examples** - Don't just explain conceptually, trace through the algorithm with 2-3 concrete examples (like specific words, numbers, or data)

2. **Step-by-step visual walkthrough** - Show each iteration/step with:
   - Current state of variables
   - Visual representation (tree structure, array state, etc.)
   - What decision is being made
   - Why that decision was made

3. **Proper code formatting** - Format all code blocks with:
   - Line breaks between each statement
   - Proper indentation for nested blocks (4 spaces per level)
   - Syntax highlighting (variables, keywords, strings, comments)
   - Inline comments explaining what each line does
   - **CRITICAL: Preserve whitespace formatting exactly as it appears in source code**

4. **Interactive visual elements** - Create flowcharts, diagrams, or visual representations showing:
   - The algorithm's flow/decision points
   - Data structure evolution at each step
   - Current vs. previous states

5. **Multiple scenarios** - Show how the algorithm handles:
   - Typical cases
   - Edge cases
   - Different input variations

6. **Key insights section** - Explain:
   - Why the algorithm works this way
   - Time/space complexity
   - Common use cases
   - What makes it efficient/inefficient

7. **Demonstration with test cases** - Show actual method calls and their results

**Format as an HTML artifact with:**
- Clean, modern styling
- Collapsible sections
- Color-coded elements
- Professional code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Visual tree/graph representations where applicable
- Use Atom One Dark colors

**CRITICAL CSS Requirements for Code Blocks:**
```css
.code-block {
    white-space: pre-wrap;  /* MUST INCLUDE - preserves line breaks and spacing */
    line-height: 1.8;       /* Proper spacing between lines */
    font-family: 'Monaco', 'Menlo', 'Courier New', monospace;
}
```

**Code Formatting Standards:**
- Each statement on its own line
- Blank lines between class definitions and methods
- Consistent 4-space indentation
- No horizontal scrolling needed
- Proper Python/language syntax conventions

**Focus on making complex algorithms understandable through concrete examples and visual learning.**
